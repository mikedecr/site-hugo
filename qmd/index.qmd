I am a quantitative researcher living in Chicago.
I work at a proprietary trading firm doing R&D for high-speed, algorithmic strategies.

I use this site to publish an occasional [blog post](blog) about statistics or programming.

I used to be a political scientist.
My PhD research focused on US electoral politics, public opinion, and Bayesian modeling.
