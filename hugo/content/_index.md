I am a quantitative researcher / software developer at an algorithmic trading firm.

I used to be a political scientist.

This site is where I publish an occasional [blog post](blog) about statistics or programming.

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/mikedecr) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mikedecr.computer).
