I am a quantitative researcher living in Chicago IL.
I work at a proprietary trading firm doing R&D for high-speed, algorithmic strategies.

I use this site to publish an occasional [blog post](blog) about statistics or programming.

I used to be a social scientist.
I finished my PhD in political science from UW--Madison in 2020.
My research focused on Bayesian measurement models and causal methods for studying elections, public opinion, and partisan ideology in the United States.
